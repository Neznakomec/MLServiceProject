So, in folder e:\Documents\PycharmProjects\
i created a "MLFlowServer.sh":

mlflow server \
    --backend-store-uri sqlite:////mlflow_example.db \
    --default-artifact-root hdfs://localhost:9000/MlflowOutput \
    --host 0.0.0.0
     -p 5000


Run it through Git Bash (comes with SourceTree):
./MLFlowServer.sh

then, db file located at "E:\"
and it created a folder "C:\Users\Username\mlruns"
